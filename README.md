Welcome to my humble abode in this hub!

I am a Raichu who sees odd silicone machines and decides to make them do whatever twisted things I feel like making them do (or at least attempts to). Thinks it would be cool to do that for a living

I mostly work on whatever I feel like working on, so expect zero consistency in my contributions and/or projects (or lack of -w-)
