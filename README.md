    Welcome to my GitHub!
    
    I am a Raichu who makes odd silicone machines do things I feel like making them do, and wishes to do so as a living.
    
    I can't say how much I will use this account for personal projects, as I am still sceptical about the whole CoPilot thing, but regardless I am happy to use this account to contribute to other projects! :3 (or not! >:3)
